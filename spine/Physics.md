Physics Spine Theorem

Statement
Operationally accessible information is bounded by energy, entropy, and spectral gap; violations imply non-physical regimes.

Dependencies
- Non-Viotropy axiom
- Spectral Gap Rigidity
- Capacity–Entropy inequality

No alternative derivation exists without violating physical realizability.
